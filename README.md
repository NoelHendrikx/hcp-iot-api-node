# HANA Cloud Platform IoT Services API (hcp-iot-api)

This is a lightweight node.js based wrapper for the [SAP HANA Cloud Platform IoT Services API](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot/frameset.htm?ad829c660e584c329200022332f04d00.html). 
Instead of wrangling with authentication and request configuration, you can use the libraries methods to communicate with the API.
Both services (Remote Device Management Servcie and Message Management Service) have been implemented in their own class and own set of methods (see documentation below).
There is also a utility class available to request OAuth tokens for configured HCP clients.

## Installation

You can install the module through the public npm registry by running the
following command in CLI:

```
npm install --save hcp-iot-api
```

## Promises

The library is using Promises for a cleaner syntax and to avoid nested callbacks.
So when there is the need to have things be done sequentially, you would normally have to write nested callbacks like this in JavaScript:

```js
// This is how the API would look without promises
rdms.createDeviceType({...} , function (deviceType) {
	rdms.createMessageType({...}, function(messageType) {		
		rdms.registerDevice({...}, function(device) {
			...
		}, function(error) { console.log(error); });
	}, function(error) { console.log(error); });
}, function(error) { console.log(error); });
```
Because all methods return Promises, it is much easer to deal with sychronous requests, avoid handling errors multiple times and keep everything more readable. So the API actually looks like this:

```js
rdms.createDeviceType({...}
	 .then(function(deviceType){
		 return rdms.createMessageType({...});
	 })
	 .then(function(messageType){
		 return rdms.registerDevice({...});
	 }).
	 .then(function(device){
		 ...
	 }).
	 catch(function(error) { console.log(error) });
```

## Remote Device Management Service (RDMS)

The [Remote Device Management Service](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot/frameset.htm?c4477ad35f1c405fb9364f279f24d973.html) is used to programatically administrate devices, device types, message types, etc.

### Setup

The RDMS always needs the users HCP username and password for authentication.

```js
var API = require("hcp-iot-api");
var rdms = new API.RemoteDeviceManagementService({
	"account": "<user>", 
	"password": "<password>"
});
```
### Reading data and posting data

The API allows to read all kinds of data from service. It's actually possible to completly configure the IoT service without accessing the GUI.

A simple example getting all message types. The return values are captured and accessiable in the `then` functions.
```js
rdms.getMessageTypes()
	.then(function(messageTypes) {
		// Do something meaningful
	})
	.catch(function(error) { console.log(error.message)	});

```
It's also possible to create entities by using the various `create` functions. The available fields can be read in the [official documentation](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot/frameset.htm?ad829c660e584c329200022332f04d00.html). Please keep in mind, that a device type needs to be created first and its deviceToken saved, as it won't be accessible via API when using `rdms.getDeviceType(id)`.

```js
rdms.createDeviceType({ "name": "Device Type 1" })
	.then(function (deviceType) {
		// Store token to register devices later
		var deviceTypeToken = deviceType.token;
	
		return rdms.createMessageType({'device_type': deviceType.id, ...});
	.then(function (messageType) {
		...
	.catch(function(error) { console.log(error.message)	});
```

# Message Management Service (MMS)

The [Message Management Service](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot/frameset.htm?7c71e35a19284736a806fb25a19dde41.html) can be used to send data from the IoT device into the Hana Cloud Platform and/or back to the device. 

### Setup

The MMS acutally is a bit more complex in terms of authorization. There are several methods, which are bound to a specific device. For exampe, if you want to send sensor data from a device into the HCP (`mms.sendData(...)`), you need the `deviceId` and `deviceToken` information. If the device was being registered via RDMS programatically, it is highly importend to store the returned deviceToken, as this is no more readable afterwards.
Other methods require a user authentication (e.g. `mms.pushToDevice(...)`). 

```js
var API = require("hcp-iot-api");
var mms = new API.MessageManagementService({
	"account": "<username>",
	"password": "<password>",
	"deviceToken": "<deviceToken>",
	"deviceId": "<deviceId>",
	"userToken": "<userToken>"
});
```	

You can pass in all the required information in the constructor or use the setter methods later on.

## Send sensor data

The main purpuse of the MMS is to send sensor data from the device into the HCP. The API is very straight forward. The following statement sends the data via HTTP(S) connection.

```js
mms.sendData({
	"messageType": "<messageTypeId>",
	"messages": [{
      "sensor1": "Value 1",
      "sensor2": "Value 2"
    }]
	})
	.catch(function(error) { console.log(error.message)	});
```	
	
# Full documentation

The following section describes the full API.

## Class: RemoteDeviceManagementService

### new API.RemoteDeviceManagementService([options])

* `options` Object
  * `account` String
  * `password` String

Construct a new rdms object. `account` and `password` need to be set for HTTP authentication.

### rdms.createDeviceType(options)

* `options` Object â€“ For a list of opions check out the [official docs](https://help.hana.ondemand.com/iot/frameset.htm?44c28d07999b47d382ff5ef3a742124a.html).

Creates a new device type.

### rdms.getDeviceTypes()

Returns all device types.

### rdms.getDeviceType(id)

* `id` String

Returns one specific device type.

### rdms.deleteDeviceType(id)

* `id` String
